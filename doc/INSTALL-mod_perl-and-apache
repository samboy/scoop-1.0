Ok, instructions on how to get and install Apache and mod_perl
aren't really within the scope of these docs, but for the totally
new, here's a simple recipe that will do the basics for you.

The following will build and install apache and mod_perl, in
/usr/local/apache. su to root, and do the following:

(NOTE: you'll need to replace replace apache_1.3.x and mod_perl-1.x with the
correct filenames/version numbers every where you see them.)

host:#] cd /usr/local/src

host:#] lynx --dump http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/apache_1.3.x.tar.gz > apache_1.3.x.tar.gz

host:#] lynx --dump http://perl.apache.org/dist/mod_perl-1.x.tar.gz > mod_perl-1.x.tar.gz

host:#] tar -zxvf mod_perl-1.x.tar.gz
-->[...list of files...]

host:#] tar -zxvf apache_1.3.x.tar.gz
-->[...list of files...]

host:#] cd mod_perl-1.x


## NOTE: if you're compiling apache and mod_perl independently, then make sure
## you pass "--disable-rule=EXPAT" to apache's configure script. otherwise, RDF
## and cron will not work, because of wackiness with expat.
##
## HOWEVER, if you are using apache 1.3.22 or newer (and you will be if you
## just downloaded it), then make sure you already have expat installed on your
## system, and leave the --disable-rule=EXPAT off. Newer Apaches will
## automatically detect and use the system expat.

host:#] perl Makefile.PL \
            APACHE_PREFIX=/usr/local/apache \
            APACHE_SRC=../apache-1.3.x/src \
            DO_HTTPD=1 \
            USE_APACI=1 \
            EVERYTHING=1 \
-->[...perl output...]

host:#] make
-->[...make output...]

host:#] make test
-->[...should tell you all tests passed, eventually...]

host:#] make install
-->[...should say that it's installed in /usr/local/apache...]

That's it!

If any of that didn't go right, try reading the docs in 
apache-1.3.x/ and mod_perl-1.x/
